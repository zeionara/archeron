The following tutorial is designed as a beginner-friendly guide of installing *arch linux*. The purpose of the project therefore is to provide a clear and concise way of installing *arch linux*, because [official tutorial][official-guide] sucks in brevity, community sucks in being helpful and other 3rd-party tutorials suck in being up-to-date, completeness and usefulness.
